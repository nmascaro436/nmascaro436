ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m NÃºria, from Menorca, Spain currently living in Helsinki, Finland.

ðŸ‘€ I have recently begun exploring the field of programming and I'm eager to deepen my understanding of software development.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C programming at Hive Helsinki.

âš¡ Prior to coding, I studied Translation and Interpreting, which gives me a unique perspective on languages, and now Iâ€™m applying that to the language of computers.
